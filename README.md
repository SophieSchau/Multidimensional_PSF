# Multidimensional_PSF
Many physical properties cannot be directly measured with MRI, but are instead derived from a number of encoded measurements. MRI acquisition can be seen as a linear operation on these underlying spatial distribution of the physical property of interest. When MRI is modelled like this the linear encoding operator contains the encoding scheme, and sampling pattern in Fourier space (k-space). These two components interact, and in this project we present a method for analysing this interaction through its effect on the multidimensional point spread function (m-PSF).
